The product aims at creating a decentralized saccos system for local communities where decisions in the particular saccos community are done democratically by votes based on the tokens owned by an individual in the saccos.

This includes 
-lending money
-making changes to the code project
-Interest rates
-actions that are related to the specific saccos community. 

The project mimicks the concept of dao -but aims at localizing the solution to be implemented through mobile payment sytems(ussd and sms)

Concept of Implementation.
-A group of people of the same interest create a "fusaco community a" where they buy tokens via the mobile payment system with a particular mobile wallet (id) in the general pool of tokens (ito) and pull them together in the "fusaco community a" .
-Incase of lending money which refers to overdrawing with the terms of returning it with a particular interest rate at a given time. And if that doesn't occur , voting will take place to return the borrowed tokens.
